"""
This script will be used to remove noisy background from cars images to
improve the quality of our data and get a better model.
The main idea is to use a vehicle detector to extract the car
from the picture, getting rid of all the background, which may cause
confusion to our CNN model.
We must create a new folder to store this new dataset, following exactly the
same directory structure with its subfolders but with new images.
